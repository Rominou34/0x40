# 0x40

A personal version of the famous [0x40](https://c66b1e1548a045925e3432c10b9d2fd8ecff9d84.googledrive.com/host/0B8QEardTLm8DQVItUFRpUXgyd3c/0x40%20Hues%20v5.11.swf) animation ( the only reason Flash should stick around a little bit ), developed using Javascript

## Install

* `git clone` this shit
* open `index.html`
* Be disappointed

## Features

* Does things based on current character from a beatmap
* Displays the current loading progress
* Is shit

## TODO

* Do more animations
* Actually do some CSS
* Create real beatmaps and not only `x-o-x-o-x...`
