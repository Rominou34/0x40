# 0x40

A personal version of the famous [0x40](https://c66b1e1548a045925e3432c10b9d2fd8ecff9d84.googledrive.com/host/0B8QEardTLm8DQVItUFRpUXgyd3c/0x40%20Hues%20v5.11.swf) animation ( the only reason Flash should stick around a little bit ), developed using Javascript

## Install

* `git clone` this shit
* open `index.html`
* Be disappointed

## Features

* Animate the shit based on current character from a beatmap
* Displays the current loading progress
* Waifuuuus !!!!!
* Colors
* Is shit

## TODO

* Do more animations
* Actually do some CSS
* More waifus
* ~~We need black outside of the waifu ( because waifu doesn't take the whole screen )~~ fuck this feature it's useless
* Create real beatmaps and not only `x-o-x-o-x...`
* Create a really cool menu allowing you to:
  * Change music
  * Change volume
  * See the current waifu
  * See the current color
